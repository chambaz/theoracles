      "reasoning": "Based on extensive research of current prediction markets, news reports, and Trump's recent statements, the Fed Chair nomination appears to be narrowing to a few key candidates. Kevin Warsh has been the consistent frontrunner across multiple prediction markets (Kalshi, Polymarket) with odds previously at 45-60%, positioning him as the clear favorite due to his previous Fed experience and Trump's known preference for him. However, recent developments show Rick Rieder gaining significant momentum after Trump called him 'very impressive,' with his odds surging from 3% to 30% in prediction markets within days. This dramatic shift reflects Trump's apparent growing interest in the BlackRock executive. Christopher Waller remains a solid contender as a current Fed Governor with mainstream credentials, making him attractive for Senate confirmation. Kevin Hassett's chances have diminished as Trump reportedly prefers him to stay in his current NEC role. Scott Bessent has been largely ruled out as he now serves as Treasury Secretary. Historical candidates like Judy Shelton and Michelle Bowman have minimal current support. The 'other' category accounts for potential surprise nominees, though Trump's statements suggest he's focusing on known quantities. Trump has indicated he may be 'down to maybe one' candidate and Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested an announcement could come soon, indicating an imminent decision. The timing is crucial as Powell's term expires in May 2026.",
