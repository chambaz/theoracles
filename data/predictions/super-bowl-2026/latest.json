      "reasoning": "The Kansas City Chiefs have a strong offensive lineup and a favorable schedule, making them top contenders. The Detroit Lions, with their predicted NFC North win and playoff chances, pose a strong challenge. The San Francisco 49ers, with potential to win more than 11.5 games, and the Philadelphia Eagles with a robust squad also stand as strong contenders. The Buffalo Bills and Baltimore Ravens are playoff contenders from the AFC, complementing their chances with robust offensive setups. The Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers show potential but lack consistency, while the Minnesota Vikings have solid projections yet face tough competition within the NFC. `Other AFC` and `Other NFC` teams cover remaining possibilities, but current powerhouse teams dominate probabilities.",

      "reasoning": "My predictions are based on current sportsbook odds, team performance, and expert analysis. The Kansas City Chiefs lead my predictions at 14% due to their consistent excellence and current 15-2 record, having won recent Super Bowls and maintaining elite quarterback play with Patrick Mahomes. The Detroit Lions at 12% reflect their emergence as legitimate contenders under Dan Campbell, with experts noting their 'wide open' Super Bowl window. The Philadelphia Eagles (11%) are consistent favorites across multiple sportsbooks at +650 odds. The Buffalo Bills (11%) and Baltimore Ravens (10%) represent the AFC's other top contenders, with MVP-caliber quarterbacks in Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson. The 49ers at 8% reflect some decline in recent projections despite historically being strong contenders. The Cowboys, Packers, and Vikings each get 6%, 6%, and 5% respectively as solid but less favored teams. The 'other' categories (9% AFC, 8% NFC) account for potential surprise teams, as the NFL often sees unexpected playoff runs. This distribution reflects both current form and the inherent unpredictability of projecting outcomes over a year in advance.",
