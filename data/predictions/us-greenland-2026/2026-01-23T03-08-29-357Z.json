      "reasoning": "The possibility of the US acquiring part of Greenland by 2026 seems low, given current geopolitical dynamics and historical context. Recent developments indicate that while the US, under President Trump, has sought to increase its influence in Greenland, including securing a 'framework' deal for extensive access, Denmark has firmly opposed selling any part of the territory. Expert analysis suggests Greenlanders are against joining the US, primarily due to concerns about autonomy and social protections.\n\nHistorically, similar initiatives failed due to political opposition from both Denmark and Greenland, with Greenland enjoying a degree of self-governance that complicates any territorial acquisition by a foreign power. Moreover, while there are strategic interests involved for NATO and countering activities by China and Russia, these do not necessarily translate into outright territorial acquisition.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of an official acquisition resolving to 'Yes' is estimated to be low at just 10%, while the chance of it resolving to 'No' is 90%. However, the importance of Greenland strategically cannot be underestimated, which may lead to continued US interest and diplomatic efforts, albeit likely short of a formal acquisition.\n\nConfidence in this prediction is moderate (0.7) based on consistent opposition from Denmark and Greenland and expert opinion, although geopolitical events can swiftly alter the landscape.",

      "reasoning": "Based on my research, the probability of the US acquiring part of Greenland in 2026 is extremely low (5%) for several key reasons:\n\n**Strong Legal and Political Barriers:**\n1. Denmark and Greenland have categorically rejected any sovereignty transfer, with Danish PM Mette Frederiksen stating Denmark 'cannot negotiate its own sovereignty'\n2. Under Denmark's constitution and the 2009 Self-Government Act, Greenland has autonomy but sovereignty remains with Denmark\n3. Any territorial transfer would require ratification by Denmark, Greenland, and the US - Denmark has made clear this is non-negotiable\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n1. Trump's January 2026 'framework agreement' with NATO explicitly respects Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland\n2. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte confirmed sovereignty issues 'did not come up' in his discussions with Trump\n3. The framework appears focused on military access and Arctic security rather than territorial acquisition\n4. Trump backed down from tariff threats after reaching this framework, suggesting he accepted a compromise\n\n**Greenlandic Opposition:**\n1. Polls show Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose US control while supporting eventual independence from Denmark\n2. Greenland's PM has explicitly stated readiness for partnership but not under Trump's original terms\n3. The Greenlandic independence movement favors sovereignty, not transfer to another power\n\n**Existing US Access:**\n1. The 1951 US-Denmark defense agreement already gives the US 'sweeping military access' to Greenland\n2. Experts note the US 'can pretty much do what it wants' militarily under existing arrangements\n\nThe 5% probability accounts for extremely unlikely scenarios such as a dramatic change in Danish/Greenlandic position or some form of limited territorial concession for specific military bases. However, all evidence points to this being politically impossible given the firm rejection by all relevant parties and the constitutional barriers involved.",
